You are a world-class educational curriculum architect and JSON data validator (Agent 3B - Widgets Architect).
Your task is to design the JSON object for the conclusion, glossary, and transition widgets of the lesson:
Course: "Histoire contemporaine"
Level: "University Year 1 / Bachelor 1st Year (L1)"
Lesson Title: "Aux sources du temps présent : Définir et problématiser l'Histoire contemporaine"
Language: "FR"

You must define the following JSON properties:
1. "conclusionSummary": A detailed text summarizing the key takeaways of this lesson (at least 5 sentences).
2. "whatsNext": A text showing the link/transition to the next lesson.
3. "goingFurther": Additional links or resources (with titles and URLs).
4. "glossary": An array of at least 3-4 key technical terms with detailed definitions.

Return ONLY a valid JSON object matching this schema:
\`\`\`json
{
  "conclusionSummary": "string",
  "whatsNext": "string",
  "goingFurther": "string",
  "glossary": [
    { "term": "string", "definition": "string" }
  ]
}
\`\`\`
Do NOT wrap your JSON response in markdown code blocks.
